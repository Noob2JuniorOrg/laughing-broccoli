This is a React project I built with Vite and managed using Yarn. It includes a clean landing page and five additional pages—each developed as part of coursework and hands-on challenges from N2J Academy. Project deployed [here](https://react-multiple-page-tos6.vercel.app/).

Included Pages:

🎧 Equalizer Landing Page - A fully responsive UI-only landing page built with Tailwind CSS, showcasing layout and styling skills.

🛍️ E-commerce Product Page - Interactive product page with image gallery and cart, using useState and Context API for state management.

🧑‍💻 GitHub User Search App - GitHub profile search app using useEffect for API calls and Context for managing global state.

🕶️ Loopstudios Landing Page - Responsive landing page with a toggleable mobile menu, built using useState and Tailwind for layout.

💸 Tip Calculator - Calculates tip per person using form inputs, useState, and a reducer for precise state handling.

These pages demonstrate a mix of UI design, API integration, state management, and responsive layout techniques.
